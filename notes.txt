needs parameters:
- Substitue out volumes
- XYZ scaling of densiy
	- define the grid size of hog wire XY
	- rope lengths of lights
	- "fill density"

- two different scripts
	- quick dirty density to get rough quantity
	- final generate pretty good, and we edit by hand


- three different light spacings by hand
- 2, 4, 6, with 3 different spacings, and a 1

- fish is 
- 302 mm long
- 165 mm from lips to COM

Installation notes:
- max fish per section: 71, 213W, 8.875A max, 10.65A with saftey factor (although maybe max is fine, since we won't be running full blast?)
- all sections will fit in an individual universe!

175mm x 115mm

- change to 4mm clearance in the y on connectors
- find a jlcpcb part for the teensy headers
- check harder for upright ethernet jack
